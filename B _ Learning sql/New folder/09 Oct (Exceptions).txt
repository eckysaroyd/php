			Exceptions:
the way to handle the run time error in pl/sql we use exceptions.
three types:
	1- Named Exceptions.
example:- this program is used the name exception it is used when no record is found or some errore was there.

create table employee(id number, name nvarchar2(20),age number,salary number);
insert into employee values(1,'ahmad',18,10000);
insert into employee values(2,'karan',20,12000);
insert into employee values(3,'harish',21,15000);
insert into employee values(4,'ankit',22,18000); 


set serveroutput on;
declare
e_id employee.id%type :=9;
e_name employee.name%type;
begin
select name into e_name from employee where id=e_id;
dbms_output.put_line('Name: ' || e_name);

EXCEPTION
when no_data_found then
dbms_output.put_line('No such customer!');
when others then
dbms_output.put_line('Error!');
end;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

example:2:

this program is used to take the input from user first any number and the second is 0 input then it shows that the number is not divide by 0.
when this example is executed with values of 4 and 0 for variables v_num1 and v_num2.

declare 
v_num1 integer:=&sv_num1;
v_num2 integer:=&sv_num2;
v_result number;
begin
v_result:=v_num1/v_num2;
dbms_output.put_line('v_result : ' || v_result);

EXCEPTION
when zero_divide
then
dbms_output.put_line('A number cannot be divided by zero.');
end;
